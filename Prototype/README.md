## Pancreatic beta-cells

This is my initial prototype for my Scientific Computing class.

The file `Function_bank.py` contains all the function definitions I used in the prototype. I've had some issues with importing functions from other files so the functions are also defined in the python notebooks.

Start your reading in the `Morris_Lecar.ipynb` file as the Morris-Lecar model is the simplified system that the Chay-Keizer model builds upon. The initial investigation of the Chay-Keizer model can be found in the `Chay_Keizer_prototype.ipynb` file. There were a number of issues that I got stuck on when investigating the Chay-Keizer model.
